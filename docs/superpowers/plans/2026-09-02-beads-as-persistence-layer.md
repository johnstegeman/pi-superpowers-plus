# Beads as Structural Persistence Layer Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `/skill:subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `/skill:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace superpowers-plus's markdown-file-only spec/plan tracking with a beads formula/molecule as the structural backbone of brainstorm → design → plan → implement → verify → finish, keeping spec prose in a diffable file, and ship a self-contained widget (in this package's own extension code) that renders the active molecule's pipeline state.

**Architecture:** Everything lives in `pi-superpowers-plus`. A new formula file plus rewrites to six `SKILL.md` files make skills pour/query/advance the molecule via bare `bd` calls (no new tool wrappers needed — `beads_create` already supports `parent`/`description`/`type`; everything else runs as bash). A new self-contained extension (`extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts`, alongside the existing `extensions/set-phase.ts`) renders the active molecule's pipeline state above the editor by shelling out to `bd mol current --json` directly via `pi.exec` — no pi-beads changes, no second repo, no dependency on code outside this package's own release cycle.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown skill editing + one TOML formula file + one new TypeScript extension file, tested with a plain-JS pure-render module (no framework — matches the existing `extensions/set-phase.ts` style).

**Design spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-beads-as-persistence-layer-design.md`

## Global Constraints

- **Single repo root.** Everything in this plan is `pi-superpowers-plus` (`docs/`, `skills/`, `extensions/`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) — no other package is modified.
- **No new tool wrappers for molecule operations.** `bd cook`, `bd mol pour`, `bd dep add --type <x>`, `bd ready --mol`, `bd mol current` are invoked as bare `bd` shell commands from skill instructions (via the agent's own `bash` tool) or via `pi.exec` from the new widget extension — the same pattern `writing-plans`/`brainstorming` already use for `bd mol wisp gc`. Only `beads_create`/`beads_update`/`beads_close`/`beads_dep` (tools from whatever beads tool package is installed, e.g. pi-beads) are used from skills where they already cover the need (e.g. creating dynamic task children under `implement` via `beads_create({ parent, description, type })`).
- **Formula step ids are fixed** and used verbatim in every skill reference: `explore`, `clarify`, `approaches`, `design`, `design-approved`, `write-spec`, `spec-review`, `spec-approved`, `implement`, `verify`, `smoke-test-approved`, `finish`. Skills reference these ids, never re-derive or rename them.
- **`implement` and `verify` are `type = "task"` in the formula, never `type = "epic"`** — beads disallows `blocks`-type edges crossing the epic/task type boundary in either direction (validated in the design spec); a task-typed step with children is still a valid molecule for `bd mol show`/`bd ready --mol`.
- **Spec content stays a file.** No task in this plan writes spec prose into a bead field. The `write-spec` bead's role is linkage only (`bd update <id> --spec-id <path>`).
- **Plan-task descriptions are write-once.** No `appendDescription` tool support is added or required anywhere in this plan (see design spec Decision 3/4).
- **Quality gates:** `npx biome check .` (biome covers `extensions/*.ts`; markdown/TOML are excluded per `biome.json`, so for those the real check is the grep fences and manual `bd cook --dry-run` verification specified per task) plus `node --test extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs` for the new render module.
- **The widget is self-contained.** It registers under its own widget key (`beads-mol`) via `ctx.ui.setWidget` from this package's own extension code — it does not depend on, modify, or coordinate with any other installed package's widget (a parallel effort is removing the old generic pi-beads widget entirely, which this plan neither depends on nor is blocked by).

### Task 1: Formula file + cook/pour verification

**Files:**
- Create: `formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml` (at the package root, in `pi-superpowers-plus`, so it ships as a template — `.beads/` is the git-ignored local DB dir and is NOT in `package.json`'s `files`, so it cannot hold the shipped template). Add `"formulas/"` to `package.json`'s `files` array so it ships. The `using-superpowers` skill copies from here into a consuming project's `.beads/formulas/` at install time — see Task 7 for the copy-on-first-use logic.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: none.
- Produces: the 12 formula step ids listed in Global Constraints, consumed by every later task's skill rewrites.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the formula file**

Create `formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml`:

```toml
formula = "superpowers-workflow"
description = "Brainstorm -> design -> plan -> implement -> verify -> finish"
version = 1
type = "workflow"

[vars.topic]
description = "The feature/topic being brainstormed"
required = true

[[steps]]
id = "explore"
title = "Explore project context: {{topic}}"
type = "task"

[[steps]]
id = "clarify"
title = "Ask clarifying questions"
type = "task"
needs = ["explore"]

[[steps]]
id = "approaches"
title = "Propose approaches"
type = "task"
needs = ["clarify"]

[[steps]]
id = "design"
title = "Present design sections"
type = "task"
needs = ["approaches"]

[[steps]]
id = "design-approved"
title = "User approves design"
type = "task"
needs = ["design"]

[steps.gate]
type = "human"

[[steps]]
id = "write-spec"
title = "Write spec to docs/superpowers/specs/"
type = "task"
needs = ["design-approved"]

[[steps]]
id = "spec-review"
title = "Spec self-review"
type = "task"
needs = ["write-spec"]

[[steps]]
id = "spec-approved"
title = "User reviews written spec"
type = "task"
needs = ["spec-review"]

[steps.gate]
type = "human"

[[steps]]
id = "implement"
title = "Implement {{topic}}"
type = "task"
needs = ["spec-approved"]

[[steps]]
id = "verify"
title = "Verify"
type = "task"
needs = ["implement"]

[[steps]]
id = "smoke-test-approved"
title = "Smoke test / manual QA sign-off"
type = "task"
needs = ["verify"]

[steps.gate]
type = "human"

[[steps]]
id = "finish"
title = "Finish development branch"
type = "task"
needs = ["smoke-test-approved"]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify it cooks with no errors**

Run in a scratch beads-initialized directory (`mkdir -p /tmp/formula-check/.beads/formulas && cp formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml /tmp/formula-check/.beads/formulas/ && cd /tmp/formula-check && bd init -q 2>&1 | tail -3`):

```bash
bd cook superpowers-workflow --var topic="test topic" --dry-run
```

Expected: 12 steps listed, `needs` chains matching the file above, three `[steps.gate]` blocks reported, no error output.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify it pours with no epic/task boundary errors**

```bash
bd mol pour superpowers-workflow --var topic="test topic"
```

Expected: `✓ Poured mol: created 16 issues` (12 steps + 3 gate beads + the root — matches the live count observed during design; if the count differs, re-check step types before proceeding), no `"epics can only block..."` / `"tasks can only block..."` error.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml package.json
git commit -m "feat: add superpowers-workflow beads formula"
```

---

### Task 2: `brainstorming` — pour molecule at start, existing-issue entry mode

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md` (Checklist section, lines 40-51 in the current file; After the Design section, line 129)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: formula step ids from Task 1 (`explore`, `clarify`, `approaches`, `design`, `design-approved`).
- Produces: the poured molecule's root id and `implement` step id, which Task 3 (`writing-plans`) consumes to create dynamic task children.

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace the wisp-per-checklist-item instruction with pour + existing-issue linking**

Replace the current Checklist intro paragraph (the line beginning "You MUST create a wisp for each of these items...") with:

```markdown
**Starting from a fresh topic:** cook and pour the workflow formula to create the epic
this brainstorming session works against:

```bash
bd cook superpowers-workflow --var topic="<topic>" --persist
bd mol pour superpowers-workflow --var topic="<topic>"
```

Note the returned root issue id (the `Root issue:` line) — this is the molecule you work
against for the rest of this skill and for `writing-plans`/`executing-plans` afterward.

**Starting from an existing issue** (e.g. "brainstorm beads-kp0"): pour a new molecule as
above, seeding `--var topic="<existing issue's title>"`, then link the new root to the
existing issue without mutating it:

```bash
bd dep add <new-root-id> <existing-issue-id> --type discovered-from
```

If `discovered-from` is rejected by your `bd` version, use `--type related` instead — both
are non-blocking link types; do not use `blocks` here. Never change the existing issue's
type, parent, or status — it stays exactly what it was.

Each checklist item below corresponds to one formula step. Claim the step when you begin
it (`bd update <step-id> --claim`), work it, and close it (`bd close <step-id> --reason
"<one-line summary>"`) only once its real output actually exists in the conversation (see
the hard-gate above) — never close several in a row within the same turn. Step ids in
this molecule: `explore`, `clarify`, `approaches`, `design`, `design-approved` (a gate —
see After the Design below), then `write-spec`/`spec-review`/`spec-approved` continue
into spec work, handed off to `writing-plans` at `implement`.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Map each checklist line to its formula step id**

Replace checklist items 1-4 (the numbered list beginning "1. **Explore project
context**") with:

```markdown
1. **Explore project context** (`bd update <explore-step-id> --claim`) — check files, docs, recent commits in the **user's current working directory** (not the skill's install directory — see `using-superpowers` → Working Directory). Close with `bd close <explore-step-id>` once done.
2. **Ask clarifying questions** (`bd update <clarify-step-id> --claim`) — one at a time, across as many turns as it takes, waiting for the user's actual reply each time, until you understand purpose/constraints/success criteria. Do not close this step after a single question.
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** (`bd update <approaches-step-id> --claim`) — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** (`bd update <design-step-id> --claim`) — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
```

Leave items 5-8 (Write design doc / Spec self-review / User reviews written spec /
Transition to implementation) as prose — they map onto `write-spec`/`spec-review`/
`spec-approved`/`implement`, handled by Step 3 below and by Task 3's rewrite of
`writing-plans`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite "After the Design" as a verdict-driven revise/recheck loop, not a one-shot gate resolve**

Replace the current line beginning "Mark the brainstorm phase complete: close any
checklist wisps..." with:

```markdown
- After presenting the design, record the verdict on the `design-approved` step so a
  resumed session or the widget can see it without replaying the conversation:
  - Approved: `bd update <design-approved-id> --set-metadata review.verdict=done`,
    then resolve the gate so `write-spec` becomes ready:
    `bd gate resolve <design-approved-gate-id>` (find the gate id via
    `bd mol current <root-id> --json` — it's the `next_step` when `design` is closed
    and the gate hasn't resolved yet).
  - Changes requested: `bd update <design-approved-id> --set-metadata
    review.verdict=iterate`, then write a specific revision summary naming exactly
    which sections/assumptions/questions need another pass:
    `bd comment <design-approved-id> "<what needs to change>"`. Re-claim `design`
    (`bd update <design-step-id> --claim`) and loop back into Step 2's design-
    presentation work — do NOT resolve the gate. Never treat "changes requested" as
    an unstructured do-over: the revision summary is what the next pass reads before
    touching the design again.
  - On resume (new session, or picking this back up after a gap): read the design
    content already written (`bd show <design-step-id>`) plus the latest verdict and
    revision summary (`bd show <design-approved-id>`) before continuing — revise the
    existing design in place; never discard earlier answered questions, approach
    trade-offs, or already-approved sections.
  - Only `review.verdict=done` permits resolving the gate. If brainstorming stops
    early for any reason (blocked, redirected, session stopped) before a verdict is
    recorded, leave the current step's status as-is (open or in_progress) for the next
    session to resume — do not close steps whose real output doesn't exist yet.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "beads_create\|ephemeral" skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md`
Expected: no remaining references to per-checklist-item wisp creation (the skill now
references `bd update --claim`/`bd close`/`bd gate resolve` against formula step ids
instead).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: brainstorming pours the superpowers-workflow molecule"
```

---

### Task 3: `writing-plans` — dynamic task children under `implement`, `plan-approved` gate

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md` (Overview wisp-creation line 18; Task Structure section 90-150; Execution Handoff section 188-212)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `implement` step id (from the molecule Task 2 poured).
- Produces: task bead ids + `plan-approved` gate id, consumed by Task 4 (`executing-plans`) and Task 5 (`subagent-driven-development`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace the "create a wisp to track Planning" line**

Replace the line beginning "At the start of planning, create a wisp to track the
phase..." with:

```markdown
At the start of planning, claim the `implement` step of the molecule brainstorming
poured: `bd update <implement-step-id> --claim`. This is the container all real task
beads are created under.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add a self-review guard against lifecycle-duplicate tasks**

Add this to the plan document's existing Self-Review section (the checklist run before
tasks are wired into beads), as a new numbered item:

```markdown
4. **Lifecycle-duplicate check:** Does any task in this plan re-implement a phase the
   molecule already executes as its own formula step — e.g. a task titled "write the
   design doc," "get the spec approved," or "get the plan approved"? Those belong to
   `write-spec`/`spec-approved`/`plan-approved`, not to a task under `implement`. Any
   task that duplicates formula-owned work is a plan bug: remove it before wiring tasks
   into beads in Step 3 below.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the plan-approved gate + dynamic task creation to Task Structure**

After the "## Task Structure" section's closing code fence (before "## Task
Separation"), add:

```markdown
## Creating Tasks as Beads

Once the task breakdown above is written out in the plan document and has passed the
lifecycle-duplicate check (Self-Review item 4), mirror it into real beads under the
`implement` step:

```bash
# One gate, every real task depends on it — nothing executes until the human approves
# the plan shape.
GATE_ID=$(bd create "Plan reviewed / ready to execute" --parent <implement-step-id> -t task --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")
bd gate create --type=human --blocks $GATE_ID --reason "Plan approval"

# One bead per task, in order, each depending on the gate and on its plan-declared
# predecessor:
TASK1_ID=$(bd create "Task 1: <name>" --parent <implement-step-id> -t task -d "<full step-by-step instructions from the plan's Task 1 body>" --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")
bd dep add $TASK1_ID $GATE_ID

TASK2_ID=$(bd create "Task 2: <name>" --parent <implement-step-id> -t task -d "<full step-by-step instructions from the plan's Task 2 body>" --json | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")
bd dep add $TASK2_ID $GATE_ID
bd dep add $TASK2_ID $TASK1_ID   # only if the plan actually orders Task 2 after Task 1
```

Each task bead's `-d`/`--description` is the task's **entire** body from the plan
document — every step, every code block, exactly as written. This bead is what
`executing-plans`/`subagent-driven-development` read during execution; the plan.md
document itself is no longer read at execution time (see Task 4/5).

**Recording the plan-approval verdict** (same revise/recheck pattern as brainstorming's
`design-approved`/`spec-approved` gates, Task 2 Step 3): when presenting the plan for
review, don't just wait silently on the gate.
- Approved: `bd update $GATE_ID --set-metadata review.verdict=done`, then
  `bd gate resolve <the-gate-id-bd-gate-create-returned>`.
- Changes requested: `bd update $GATE_ID --set-metadata review.verdict=iterate`, write
  a specific revision summary (`bd comment $GATE_ID "<what needs to change>"`), revise
  the affected task beads' descriptions in place (`bd update <task-id> --description
  "<revised instructions>"`) or add/remove/re-order task beads as needed, and re-present
  — do NOT resolve the gate. On resume, read the existing task beads under `implement`
  (`bd mol show <implement-step-id>`) plus the latest revision summary before revising,
  rather than starting the breakdown over.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Rewrite Execution Handoff to close the gate-wiring work, not a wisp**

Replace the two "close the planning wisp..." lines (188 and the graceful-exit variant)
with:

```markdown
After the task beads and `plan-approved` gate are created and wired, the `implement`
step's own claim is left open on purpose — it stays `in_progress`, representing the
whole implementation phase, until every task bead under it closes (see `executing-plans`
Step 3, "Rewrite Complete Development"). Nothing further to close here; the plan is now
the bead graph itself.

Also update the two now-stale plan-file references elsewhere in this skill so nothing
contradicts the "plan.md is retired" design: replace line 26's
`**Save plans to:** \`docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\`` with
`**Plan output:** dynamic task beads under the molecule's \`implement\` step (see
"Creating Tasks as Beads" below) — no markdown plan file is written.`, and replace the
Boundaries line `- Write to docs/superpowers/plans/: yes` with
`- Write to docs/superpowers/plans/: no (plan output is beads, not a file)`.

If planning stops early for any reason (blocked, redirected, session stopped), leave
`implement` and any partially-created task beads as-is — the next session resumes by
reading `bd mol show <implement-step-id>` to see what's already wired.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Update the execution-handoff prose to point at the molecule, not a filename**

Replace the "Plan complete and saved to `docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md`" handoff
message with:

```markdown
**"Plan complete — <N> tasks created under `<implement-step-id>`, gated by
`<plan-approved-gate-id>`. Once you approve, I'll record `review.verdict=done` and
resolve the gate to unblock execution (see Step 3's verdict recording). Two execution
options:**
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "docs/superpowers/plans\|ephemeral" skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`
Expected: no remaining references to writing a plan markdown file or creating a wisp —
only the bead-creation commands from Step 3 and the molecule-based handoff from Step 5.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: writing-plans creates dynamic task beads under implement"
```

---

### Task 4: `executing-plans` — molecule-driven execution loop

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md` (Step 1 "Load and Review Plan" lines 27-35; Step 2 "Execute Batch" lines 36-44; Step 5 "Complete Development" lines 58-63)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `implement` step id, `plan-approved` gate id, task bead ids (from Task 3).
- Produces: none (terminal consumer of the molecule for this plan's scope).

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite "Load and Review Plan" to read the molecule instead of a file**

Replace Step 1's four numbered lines with:

```markdown
1. Load the molecule: `bd mol current <implement-step-id> --json` — this returns every
   task bead's status and the current/next step, replacing "read plan file."
2. Review critically — read each task bead's full description
   (`bd show <task-id>`) and identify any questions or concerns about the plan.
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting.
4. If no concerns: confirm the `plan-approved` gate is resolved
   (`bd show <plan-approved-gate-id>` — status should be `closed`; if not, stop and ask
   the human to run `bd gate resolve <plan-approved-gate-id>` before proceeding).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite "Execute Batch" to use claim/close instead of TaskUpdate-style status**

Replace Step 2's four numbered lines with:

```markdown
For each task, working the ready frontier (`bd ready --mol <implement-step-id>` shows
what's unblocked right now):
1. Claim it: `bd update <task-id> --claim` (atomically sets assignee + `in_progress`).
2. Follow the task bead's full description exactly (it holds the same bite-sized steps a
   plan.md task body used to hold).
3. Run verifications as specified in the description.
4. Close it: `bd close <task-id> --reason "<what was done>"` — this unblocks whatever
   depended on it; re-run `bd ready --mol <implement-step-id>` to see the next batch.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite "Complete Development" to close `implement` and advance to `verify`**

Replace Step 5's line "After all tasks complete and verified:" block's lead-in with:

```markdown
After all tasks complete and verified — confirm with `bd ready --mol
<implement-step-id>` returning empty — close the `implement` step itself
(`bd close <implement-step-id> --reason "all tasks complete"`), which unblocks `verify`.
Claim `verify` (`bd update <verify-step-id> --claim`) and proceed to that work before the
finishing-a-development-branch handoff below.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Update the "When to Stop and Ask for Help" blocked-task guidance**

Replace the line beginning "If you stop on a blocker or abort mid-batch..." with:

```markdown
If you stop on a blocker or abort mid-batch, do not silently leave the current task bead
in `in_progress`: mark it `blocked` (`bd update <task-id> --status blocked` with a
`bd comment <task-id> "<blocker>"` explaining why), or leave it `in_progress` for resume,
and on resume re-claim it (`bd update <task-id> --claim`) to continue.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "read plan file\|TaskUpdate\|plan\.md" skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md`
Expected: no output — every reference to reading a plan file or TaskUpdate-style status
is gone.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: executing-plans drives the implement molecule via bd ready/claim/close"
```

---

### Task 5: `subagent-driven-development` — same molecule loop, batch-dispatch variant

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` (setup section lines 155-160; task-loop completion lines 375-377)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: same molecule ids as Task 4.
- Produces: none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite the setup section to read the molecule instead of creating tasks**

Replace the paragraph beginning "Read the plan once, note its context and Global
Constraints, and create a beads issue per plan task..." with:

```markdown
Read the molecule once (`bd mol current <implement-step-id> --json`), note its context
and Global Constraints from each task bead's description, and confirm the
`plan-approved` gate is closed (`bd show <plan-approved-gate-id>`) before dispatching any
subagent. Task ids and their `needs` ordering already exist as real dependency edges —
no `TaskCreate`-equivalent step is needed here; `writing-plans` already created them
(see its Task Structure section).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite the task-loop completion line**

Replace the line "Then mark the task complete via `TaskUpdate({ taskId: <id>, status:
"completed" })` and move on. Never" with:

```markdown
Then close the task bead (`bd close <task-id> --reason "<summary>"`) and move on. Never
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "TaskCreate\|TaskUpdate\|beads_create.*Task N" skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: subagent-driven-development reads the implement molecule directly"
```

---

### Task 6: `test-driven-development` / `verification-before-completion` — map onto verify/smoke-test-approved/finish

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md` (phase-wisp lines ~18, ~255)
- Modify: `skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md` (phase-wisp lines ~25, ~133)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `verify`, `smoke-test-approved`, `finish` step ids.
- Produces: none (terminal steps for this plan's scope).

- [ ] **Step 1: Rewrite `test-driven-development`'s phase-tracking line**

Replace the line beginning "**Track the phase:** when the TDD implementation cycle
begins, create a wisp..." with:

```markdown
**Track the phase:** this skill's TDD cycles happen inside individual task beads
(claimed via `bd update <task-id> --claim` per `executing-plans`) — no separate wisp is
created here.
```

Replace the line beginning "When the TDD implementation cycle is complete..." with:

```markdown
When the TDD implementation cycle is complete for a given task (all tests green, code
committed), close that task bead per `executing-plans` Step 2 — this skill doesn't own
its own close step.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite `verification-before-completion`'s phase-tracking line**

Replace the line beginning "When verification begins, create a wisp..." with:

```markdown
When verification begins, claim the molecule's `verify` step: `bd update <verify-step-id> --claim`.
```

Replace the line beginning "When all verification passes, mark the verify phase
complete..." with:

```markdown
When all verification passes, close the `verify` step (`bd close <verify-step-id>
--reason "verification passed"`), which unblocks `smoke-test-approved`. That gate needs a
human to actually run/confirm the smoke test before resolving it
(`bd gate resolve <smoke-test-approved-gate-id>`) — announce this to the user rather than
resolving it yourself. Once resolved, claim and work `finish`
(`bd update <finish-step-id> --claim`), handing off to
`/skill:finishing-a-development-branch` as today.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify**

Run: `grep -n "ephemeral\|create a wisp" skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: TDD/verification skills advance verify/smoke-test-approved/finish steps"
```

---

### Task 7: Reference docs + formula-copy bootstrap in `using-superpowers`

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` (add a formula-bootstrap check near the existing "Session Start: beads cleanup" section)
- Modify: `skills/using-superpowers/references/pi-tools.md`
- Modify: `README.md`
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the formula file path from Task 1.
- Produces: none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add formula-bootstrap check to `using-superpowers`**

In `skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`, immediately after the existing "## Session
Start: beads cleanup" section's numbered list (before the next `##` heading), add:

```markdown
5. Confirm the superpowers workflow formula is available in this project:
   `bd formula list | grep superpowers-workflow`. If missing, copy it in from this
   package's bundled copy (`formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml` inside
   the installed `pi-superpowers-plus` package directory) into the project's
   `.beads/formulas/superpowers-workflow.formula.toml`, then re-run
   `bd formula list` to confirm it's now visible. Never overwrite an existing formula
   file of the same name — a user-customized formula takes precedence.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Rewrite `pi-tools.md`'s tracking description**

Replace the beads row's description text (the bullet list following the tools table) to
add, after the existing "Repo routing" bullet:

```markdown
- **Structural workflow:** brainstorm → design → plan → implement → verify → finish is
  modeled as a beads molecule poured from the bundled `superpowers-workflow` formula
  (`bd cook`/`bd mol pour`), not tracked via ad hoc wisps. Skills advance it with bare
  `bd` calls (`bd update --claim`, `bd close`, `bd gate resolve`, `bd ready --mol`) —
  see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-beads-as-persistence-layer-design.md` for the
  full step graph.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Update README's workflow-progress paragraph**

Replace the paragraph describing task tracking via beads tools (the one beginning
"Progress through the workflow is tracked with the beads tools...") with:

```markdown
Progress through the workflow is tracked as a real beads molecule — a dependency graph
poured from a formula, with human-approval gates as first-class nodes (design, spec, plan,
and smoke-test sign-off) instead of prose instructions. Plan tasks are beads with their
full instructions in the `description` field, not a separate markdown plan file; the spec
document remains a markdown file, linked from its bead via `--spec-id` for traceability.
This package's own molecule widget renders the active pipeline's current/next step above
the editor.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add CHANGELOG entry**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, under `## [Unreleased]`, add a new `### Changed` bullet:

```markdown
- **Structural persistence moved from markdown plan files to a beads molecule.**
  Brainstorming pours a `superpowers-workflow` formula into a real epic; plan tasks are
  beads with full instructions in their descriptions (no more
  `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md`); execution reads `bd ready --mol`/`bd mol current`
  instead of parsing checkboxes. Spec documents remain markdown files for diffability,
  linked from their bead via `--spec-id`. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-beads-as-persistence-layer-design.md`.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify**

```bash
grep -n "superpowers-workflow" skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md skills/using-superpowers/references/pi-tools.md README.md CHANGELOG.md
```
Expected: at least one match in each of the four files.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md skills/using-superpowers/references/pi-tools.md README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: describe the beads-molecule workflow and formula bootstrap"
```

### Task 8: molecule widget — pure state fetch + render function

**Files:**
- Create: `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.mjs` (pure parser + render function, plain JS so it's trivially unit-testable without a TS build step)
- Create: `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `bd mol current --json` output shape (documented inline below).
- Produces: `parseMoleculeCurrent(json)` and `moleculeWidgetLines(state, width, theme)`, consumed by Task 9's `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Create `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs`:

// ---------- parser: malformed input never throws ----------
assert.deepEqual(parseMoleculeCurrent(""), null);
assert.deepEqual(parseMoleculeCurrent("not json"), null);
assert.deepEqual(parseMoleculeCurrent("[]"), null);

// ---------- parser: happy path ----------
const RAW = JSON.stringify([
  {
    molecule_id: "bd-mol-g0z",
    molecule_title: "superpowers-workflow",

      { issue: { id: "bd-mol-9ev", issue_type: "task" }, status: "pending" },
    ],
  },
]);
const parsed = parseMoleculeCurrent(RAW);
assert.equal(parsed.molecule_id, "bd-mol-g0z");
assert.equal(parsed.doneCount, 1);
assert.equal(parsed.total, 4);
assert.equal(parsed.current_step.title, "Ask clarifying questions");

// ---------- render: nothing to draw ----------
assert.deepEqual(moleculeWidgetLines(null, 80), []);
assert.deepEqual(moleculeWidgetLines(parsed, 0), []);

// ---------- render: header + current step ----------
const lines = moleculeWidgetLines(parsed, 80);
assert.ok(lines[0].includes("superpowers-workflow"));
assert.ok(lines[0].includes("1/4"));
assert.ok(lines.some((l) => l.includes("Ask clarifying questions")));

// ---------- render: gate-as-current gets the waiting glyph ----------
const gateCurrent = {
  ...parsed,
  current_step: { id: "bd-mol-8y2", title: "Gate: human", issue_type: "gate" },
};
const gateLines = moleculeWidgetLines(gateCurrent, 80);
assert.ok(gateLines.some((l) => l.includes("Waiting on you")));

// ---------- render: pending count folds into one row ----------
assert.ok(lines.some((l) => l.includes("pending")));

// ---------- phase label mapping ----------
const explorePhase = {
  ...parsed,
  current_step: { id: "bd-mol-meq", title: "Explore project context: x", issue_type: "task", formula_step_id: "explore" },
};
assert.ok(moleculeWidgetLines(explorePhase, 80)[0].includes("Brainstorming"));

console.log("beads-molecule-widget: all assertions passed");

### Task 9: molecule widget — extension registration + refresh hooks

**Files:**
- Create: `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts`
- Modify: `package.json` (`pi.extensions` array, if it lists files individually rather than the directory)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `parseMoleculeCurrent`, `moleculeWidgetLines` from Task 8.
- Produces: none (terminal consumer — the registered extension itself).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the extension file**

Create `extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts`, modeled directly on the existing
`extensions/set-phase.ts` in this same directory for style (default-export factory,
`ExtensionAPI` type import) but registering event hooks instead of a tool:

```ts
import type { ExtensionAPI } from "@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent";
import { parseMoleculeCurrent, moleculeWidgetLines } from "./beads-molecule-widget.mjs";

export default function (pi: ExtensionAPI) {
  let uiRef: any = null;
  let activeMolecule: ReturnType<typeof parseMoleculeCurrent> | null = null;

  // No timers, ever: refreshed at session_start and every agent_start. Skills run bare
  // `bd cook`/`bd mol pour`/`bd dep add`/`bd create --parent` outside any tool call this
  // extension could hook, so a per-turn safety-net read is required, not optional.
  async function refreshMolecule(cwd: string): Promise<void> {
    const r = await pi.exec("bd", ["mol", "current", "--json"], {
      cwd,
      timeout: 5000,
    });
    if (!r || r.code !== 0) {
      // only clear on a clean "no active molecule" signal, never on a transient
      // failure — an unreachable `bd` binary should not blank a widget that was
      // showing real progress a moment ago.
      if (r && /no active molecule|not found/i.test(r.stderr ?? "")) activeMolecule = null;
      return;
    }
    const parsed = parseMoleculeCurrent(r.stdout);
    if (parsed) activeMolecule = parsed;
  }

  function renderMolecule() {
    try {
      if (!uiRef?.setWidget) return;
      if (!activeMolecule) {
        uiRef.setWidget("beads-mol", undefined);
        return;
      }
      uiRef.setWidget(
        "beads-mol",
        (_tui: any, theme: any) => ({
          render: (width: number) =>
            moleculeWidgetLines(activeMolecule, width - 1, uiRef?.theme ?? theme).map(
              (l: string) => ` ${l}`,
            ),
          invalidate: () => {},
        }),
        { placement: "aboveEditor" },
      );
    } catch {
      /* ui may be unavailable in non-interactive runs — never fatal */
    }
  }

  pi.on("session_start", async (_event: any, ctx: any) => {
    uiRef = ctx?.ui ?? null;
    const cwd = ctx?.cwd ?? process.cwd();
    void refreshMolecule(cwd).then(
      () => renderMolecule(),
      () => {
        /* bd missing/broken -> widget just stays empty */
      },
    );
  });

  pi.on("agent_start", async (_event: any, ctx: any) => {
    const cwd = ctx?.cwd ?? process.cwd();
    void refreshMolecule(cwd).then(
      () => renderMolecule(),
      () => {},
    );
  });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the extension is picked up by the package's extension loader**

```bash
grep -A3 '"extensions"' package.json
```

Expected: `"extensions": ["./extensions"]` — a directory reference, meaning pi's loader
picks up every extension file in that directory automatically and no `package.json`
change is needed. If the loader instead lists files individually, add
`"./extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts"` alongside the existing
`"./extensions/set-phase.ts"` entry.

- [ ] **Step 3: Manual smoke test**

In a scratch project with the formula from Task 1 poured and a step claimed:

```bash
cd /tmp/formula-check
bd update <explore-step-id> --claim
```

Start a pi session in that directory with this package installed; confirm the
`beads-mol` widget renders above the editor showing "Brainstorming · superpowers-workflow ·
0/N" and the claimed step's title. Close the step and start a new turn; confirm the
widget's progress count updates without any manual refresh action, and that closing the
molecule's last step causes the widget to clear.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify**

```bash
npx biome check extensions/
node --test extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs
```
Expected: both pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts package.json
git commit -m "feat: register the molecule widget extension"
```

---

### Task 10: CHANGELOG + version bump

**Files:**
- Modify: `package.json` (version field)
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: none.
- Produces: none (release bookkeeping).

- [ ] **Step 1: Bump the package version**

Check the current version and bump the minor: `grep '"version"' package.json` (this
plan does not hardcode the current value since Tasks 1-7 may land first and change it) —
increment the minor component (new widget surface, no breaking change to any existing
skill-facing interface).

- [ ] **Step 2: Add CHANGELOG entry for the widget**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, under `## [Unreleased]`, add to the `### Changed` bullet from Task 7
Step 4 (or as a new adjacent bullet if that entry already landed and is no longer
`[Unreleased]`):

```markdown
- **New molecule widget** (`extensions/beads-molecule-widget.ts`) renders the active
  superpowers molecule's pipeline state (current phase, current/next step, pending
  count) above the editor — shells out to `bd mol current --json` directly via
  `pi.exec`, refreshed at session start and every turn (no polling).
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify**

```bash
npx biome check .
node --test extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs
```
Expected: both pass.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: version bump for the molecule widget"
```

---

## Verification

- **Formula + skills:** `npx biome check .` passes; grep fences in Tasks 2-7's verify
  steps all return empty/expected output; `bd cook superpowers-workflow --dry-run` and
  `bd mol pour` succeed against the formula from Task 1 (re-verify after any skill
  wording changes, since the formula file itself doesn't change after Task 1).
- **Widget:** `node --test extensions/beads-molecule-widget.test.mjs` passes; manual
  smoke test from Task 9 Step 3 confirms the widget renders and updates live in a real
  pi session, with no dependency on any other installed package.
- **End-to-end (manual, not automated by this plan):** run a full brainstorm → design →
  plan → implement → verify → finish cycle in a scratch project with this package
  installed, confirming every gate actually blocks progress until resolved and the
  widget tracks the pipeline correctly throughout.
